# rethinking-strings

## Overview

This is a "toy" library developed for ["Rethinking
Strings"](https://cppnow2017.sched.com/event/A8Id), a talk at C++Now 2017.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome via github pull requests, though see the note about
building below.

Before you start working with the project, please read our [Developer
Certificate of Origin](https://cla.vmware.com/dco). All contributions to this
repository must be signed as described on that page. Your signature certifies that
you wrote the patch or have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch.

## Building

This project uses CMake. In my environment, I use a plethora of command line
options to configure CMake to use a snapshot of llvm/clang/ibc++.

You _may_ be able to get it to build, but you are very much on your own.
